| EMPIRE      | NTNU               | Optimize power plants operation and investments in power generation and transmission capacity              | EMPIRE incorporates long-term and short-term system dynamics, while optimizing investments under operational uncertainty. By decoupling the optimization of system operation at each investment period from future investment in transmission infrastructure and operation periods, a computationally tractable optimization problem is produced                        | Finished           |
| e-Transport | SINTEF             | Optimal operation and investment path for energy systems over a planning horizon of several decades to bring available energy to the end user             | It optimizes investments in infrastructure over a planning horizon of several decades to bring available energy to the end user in such quantities and in such form that the end users demand is covered in the economically and environmentally best way possible. As part of the investment analysis, however, the model also optimizes diurnal operation for different periods of the year for each alternative system design. This operational module can be run independently from the investment module.                       | Finished           |
