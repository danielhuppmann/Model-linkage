## Model linkage mappings and definitions

This repository aims to share the mapping of some models to be used in [openENTRANCE](https://openentrance.eu/) is based on these three principles:

* Define the hierarchical relations among the different concepts used for variable and region domains of the **common data format**
* Define a set of consistent names, definitions, and meanings for the different concepts

The first rule is to define a single set of pre-defined reserved words to be used in the data-exchange platform. A reserved word canâ€™t be used for two different concepts in the platform.
The **common data format** are thought to be valid both for dynamic data, changing over time (e.g., hourly data), and static data (e.g., yearly data). Besides, we will need to represent both deterministic data (those for which there is certainty over the evolution of the corresponding data) and stochastic data, which depend on uncertain scenarios.
Within the **common data format**, there are six dimensions:

1.	Model
2.	Scenario
3.	Region
4.	Variable
5.	Unit
6.	Subannual

Next, we describe in detail the information to be provided in each dimension. This definition must be exhaustive (cover all the data in the models considered) and avoid duplicities that might lead to inconsistencies. That is, all data should be defined once and just once.

## 1. Model
This dictionary of model can be linked through this exchange format. Given the intended openness of the exchange format, models inside and outside the openENTRANCE consortium are welcome. A brief description of the model is provided in the next link. Model name and version will be specified:

|  __Model__  |  __Version__  |
|-------------|---------------|
| EMPIRE      |               |
| e-Transport |               |
| EXIOMOD     |               |
| FanSi       |               |
| FRESH:COM   |               |
| GENeSYS-MOD |               |
| HERO        |               |
| openTEPES   |               |
| OSCARS      |               |
| Plan4EU     |               |
| REMES-EU    |               |
| SCOPE-SD    |               |

## 2. Scenario

</td><td>

|b|1|2|3|
